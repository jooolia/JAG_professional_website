I am working my way through the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and I am posting my work on the exercises in a [Github repo](https://github.com/jooolia/IntroStatLearning). 
For Chapter 2 my exercises are viewable in the github repo at this link: https://jooolia.github.io/IntroStatLearning/Exercises/chapter_2/chapter_2_questions.html
Comments and improvements are always welcome.
